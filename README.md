The repository demonstrates the webnative platform API for publishing apps. The API includes four methods:

- `webnative.apps.index`: List all of your apps and their associated domain names
- `webnative.apps.create`: Create a new app, assign an initial subdomain, and set an asset placeholder
- `webnative.apps.publish`: Publish a new app version
- `webnative.apps.deleteByDomain`: Destroy an app by domain name

Please see the [Platform API for Apps](https://talk.fission.codes/t/platform-api-for-apps/2019) post and the [Platform APIs guide](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative/platform) for more details.
